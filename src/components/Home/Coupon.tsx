          When the wheel stops spinning and lands on a discount, a pop-up modal
          will appear, revealing your exclusive coupon code. This code is your
          key to savings, and we've made it incredibly simple to use. Just click
          the 'Copy' button within the modal, and your coupon code will be
          instantly copied to your clipboard. You can then paste it at checkout
          to enjoy your discount and make the most of your RideWave experience.
          Don't miss out on these exclusive offersâ€”spin, save, and ride!
