            modal will appear, revealing your exclusive coupon code. This code

            Just click the 'Copy' button within the modal, and your coupon code
            will be instantly copied to your clipboard. You can then paste it at
            checkout to enjoy your discount and make the most of your RideWave
            experience. Don't miss out on these exclusive offersâ€”spin, save, and
            ride!
